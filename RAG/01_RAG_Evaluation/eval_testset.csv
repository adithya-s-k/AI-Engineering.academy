How do additive and scaled dot-product attention compare in efficiency and scaling?,"['\n\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax( √dk Q KT ) V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor √1/dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by √1/dk.\n']","Additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk.

How do initial training steps affect learning rate and optimization time with the hardware used?,"['\n\n5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\nlrate = dmodel−0.5· min(stepnum−0.5, stepnum · warmupsteps−1.5)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmupsteps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

What makes Transformers better for parallelization than recurrent networks?,"['\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n']","Transformers are better for parallelization than recurrent networks because they rely entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, which allows for significantly more parallelization compared to the inherently sequential nature of recurrent networks.",reasoning,"[{'file_path': '/home/adithya/workspace/AI-Engineering.academy/RAG/01_RAG_Evaluation/../data/attention_is_all_you_need.md', 'file_name': 'attention_is_all_you_need.md', 'file_type': 'text/markdown', 'file_size': 35417, 'creation_date': '2024-09-09', 'last_modified_date': '2024-09-09'}]",True
