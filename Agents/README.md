- Emergent behavior management

### 2. 📋 Planning and Strategy

Master strategic decision-making and task planning for autonomous agents.

- Goal decomposition
- Action sequence planning
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Adaptive planning strategies

### 3. 🔄 Reflection and Learning

Implement self-improvement mechanisms for more capable agents.

- Performance self-evaluation
- Strategy adaptation
- Learning from experience
- Error recovery
- Continuous improvement loops

### 4. 🛠️ Tool Usage

Develop agents that can effectively utilize external tools and APIs.

- Tool selection logic
- API integration patterns
- Error handling
- Resource management
- Tool chain orchestration

## 🚀 Practical Projects
