We describe clinical characteristics of IPAF patients and examine responses to mycophenolate as a therapy for IPAF.\n\n### Methods\n\nThis retrospective cohort included adult patients meeting European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society classification criteria for IPAF. Sociodemographic, clinical, and pulmonary function test data were abstracted for patients with and without mycophenolate treatment and followed longitudinally from interstitial lung disease diagnosis for change in pulmonary function test results.\n\n### Results\n\nWe identified 52 patients who met criteria for IPAF. Of 52 IPAF patients, 24 did not receive mycophenolate and 28 did, with median time to mycophenolate treatment 22 months. Changes in FVC% and percentage predicted lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) between the mycophenolate-treated and untreated groups were not significantly different (FVC% change _P_\\=0.08, DLCO% change _P_\\=0.17). However, there was a trend toward more rapid baseline decline of both FVC% and DLCO% in the mycophenolate-treated cohort before vs after mycophenolate therapy. The slope of both FVC% and DLCO% values improved after onset of mycophenolate exposure for the treated group, although this finding was not statistically significant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPatients with IPAF might benefit from mycophenolate therapy. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of mycophenolate for patients who meet criteria for IPAF" , "chunk_metadata": {"link":"adithyask.com"}}}

In lung-dominant CTD, a disease similar but not identical to IPAF, mycophenolate, an immunosuppressive agent that impairs lymphocytogenesis, has shown therapeutic promise. In a retrospective cohort study of 19 patients with lung-dominant CTD, mycophenolate therapy was associated with trends toward improvement in pulmonary function test (PFT) values,[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6219314/#b2-tcrm-14-2171) but no comparison group was included. Other studies demonstrating benefits of mycophenolate have included a small number of patients with undifferentiated CTD and ILD within a broader pool of defined CTD-ILD patients.[3],", "chunk_metadata": {"link":"neuratrial.com"} }}
