AI-related careers are becoming increasingly sought-after. However, the abundance of learning resources scattered across the internet can lead to confusion about where to start.&#x20;

**AI Engineering Academy** aims to provide a structured learning path to help you learn Applied GenAI effectively.

## Roadmap

### [**1. Prompt Engineering**](PromptEngineering/)

This roadmap will cover the basics of prompt engineering and its role in various AI applications.

### [**2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**](RAG/)

If you've been in the AI space, you might have heard of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). In this roadmap, we will cover:

- Understanding what RAG is
- Implementing RAG from scratch without using any frameworks
- Choosing the best RAG system for your needs
- Taking a RAG system to production

### [**3. Fine-tuning**](Finetuning/)

**(coming soon)**

We will debunk some myths about fine-tuning and explore where it can be effectively used. Fine-tuning can be a powerful tool, but it's often misunderstood. Expect to learn:

- The true potential of fine-tuning
- Proper techniques for fine-tuning models

### [**4. Deployment**](Deployment/)

**(coming soon)**

While everything might work perfectly locally, putting models into the hands of users requires careful consideration. In this roadmap, we will cover:

- Deploying ML and DL models into production
- Working with different cloud providers
- Exploring various deployment modes

### [**5. AI Agents**](Agents/)

**(coming soon)**

### [**6. Projects**](Projects/)

**(coming soon)**

Consists of multiple hands-on end-to-end AI projects!!
