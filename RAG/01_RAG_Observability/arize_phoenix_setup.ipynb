    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we have set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Llama Index and integrated it with various components to observe its functionality. We began by configuring and installing the necessary libraries, including Llama Index, OpenTelemetry, and various embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceeded to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize and configure the embedding models, using FastEmbed or OpenAI models as needed.\n",
    "- Load and index documents from a directory to prepare the data for querying.\n",
    "- Set up a query engine to perform searches and retrieve relevant information based on the indexed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you have successfully prepared a RAG pipeline capable of efficient document retrieval and query processing. This setup enables advanced search and information retrieval capabilities, leveraging the power of vector-based embeddings and indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with different configurations and queries to further explore the capabilities of the RAG pipeline. For any questions or additional customization, consult the documentation of the libraries used or seek further guidance.\n",
