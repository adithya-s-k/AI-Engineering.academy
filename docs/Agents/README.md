## Core Patterns

### 1. Reflection and Learning

Implement self-improvement mechanisms for more capable agents.

- Performance self-evaluation
- Strategy adaptation
- Learning from experience
- Error recovery
- Continuous improvement loops

### 2. Tool Usage

Develop agents that can effectively utilize external tools and APIs.

- Tool selection logic
- API integration patterns
- Error handling
- Resource management
- Tool chain orchestration

### 3. Planning and Strategy

Master strategic decision-making and task planning for autonomous agents.

- Goal decomposition
- Action sequence planning
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Adaptive planning strategies

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems

Learn to implement collaborative AI systems where multiple agents work together to achieve complex goals.

- Agent communication protocols
- Task distribution and coordination
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Emergent behavior management

## Practical Projects

### Multi-Document Agents

An implementation showcase for handling multiple documents:

- Concurrent document processing
- Information extraction
- Cross-reference analysis
- Content summarization
- Knowledge synthesis

## Implementation Guidelines

         - Clear responsibility definition
         - Robust error handling
         - Efficient resource usage
         - Scalable architecture

2.  **System Integration**

         - API standardization
         - Communication protocols
         - Security considerations
         - Performance optimization

3.  **Testing and Validation**

         - Unit testing strategies
         - Integration testing
         - Performance benchmarking
         - Behavior validation
